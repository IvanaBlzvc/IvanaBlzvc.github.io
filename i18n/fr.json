    "messageEqValuesP3": "The Internet is a platform for free expression and self-determination. Like any communication tool, the Internet is not immune from censorship, surveillance, attacks and attempts by state actors and criminal groups to silence dissident voices. When democratic expression is criminalised, when there is ethnic and political discrimination, the Internet becomes another battleground for non-violent resistance",
    "messageEqValuesP4": "Our mission is to promote and defend fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the free flow of information online. Our goal is to create accessible technology and improve the skill set needed for defending human rights and freedoms in the digital age",

We are software developers, cryptographers, security specialists, as well as educators, sociologists, historians, anthropologists and journalists.

We try to lead by example by not compromising the security properties of a tool or system for the sake of speed, usability or cost. We do not believe in security through obscurity and we maintain transparency through open access to our code base. We always err on the side of caution and try to implement good internal operational security",
    "messageEqValuesP10": "As an organisation, we seek to be transparent with our policies and procedures. As often as possible, our source code is open and freely available, protected by licences that encourage community-driven development, sharing and the propagation of these principles",

Freedom of expression includes active and heated debate, even arguments that are inelegantly articulated, poorly constructed and that may be considered offensive to some.

When we become aware of any use that violates our principles or terms of service, we take action to stop it. Guided by our internal policies, we carefully deliberate over acts that might compromise our principles. Our procedures will continue to evolve based on experience and best practices so that we can achieve the right balance between enabling open access to our products and services, and upholding our principles",
