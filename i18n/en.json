    "faqContent2a4": "But if you delete a _**repository**_ that you have shared with another device or peer, you can re-import it from them back into your primary device. ",

    "faqContent2a11": "_The data from their students' _**repositories**_ will sync with the teacher’s new _**repository**_.  That way the teacher’s _**repository**_ will contain all the data from students’ _**repositories**_ and they will also have the **write access**._ ",

    "faqContent3c1": "Yes",

    "faqContent4a1": "Yes. On Android devices that have **Biometric protection** set up, you can use it to secure your _**Ouisync repositories**_ and to enter _**repository**_ **Security screen**. ",
    "faqContent4a2": "You can activate the **biometrics protection** at the time of creating or importing a _**repository**_.  You can also do it later on by going to the **Security screen** and activating the **Secure using biometrics** option. ",

    "faqContent53": "Or you can import files into one of the existing folders. ",
    "faqTitle6": "What does it mean to 'import' a repository?",
    "faqContent60": "To import a _**repository**_ means that you want to recreate on your device a _**repository**_ that a peer has [shared](#sharing) with you. ",
    "faqContent61": "You start with the **+** button and then select **Import**:",
    "faqContent62": "Tapping on the **Import repository** button will bring you to this screen:",
    "faqContent63": "Here you have two options - you can scan a **QR code** generated by your peer or import a **link** your peer has sent you. The **link** looks like this:",

    "faqContent66": "The imported _**repository**_ will appear on your screen and after a short while all its content will be imported into your device.  In other words, the Ouisync _**repositories**_ on your devices will sync their data with the _**Ouisync repositories**_ on your peer’s device.  This will happen automatically, without any further action performed by you. ",
    "faqContent67": " Once the **syncing** is complete, you will see the **green check** icon next to the _**repository name**_. This means that you now have on your device the exact copy of the _**repository**_ that your peer has shared with you.  ",
    "faqContent68": "Peer who shares _**repository**_ decides what **access mode** (or permissions) to give to the peers who import it.  To learn more, see section [Sharing](#sharing).  **Access mode** is visible just above the _**repository**_ name on the **Import Repository** dialog box. ",
    "faqTitle7": "Can I use my Ouisync repository for Secure Data Storage?",
    "faqContent70": " Yes. To do that, please follow these steps: ",
    "faqContent71": "**Step 1:** Create a _**repository**_ in a normal way, and add data that you want to store to it. ",

    "faqContent74": "**Step 4:** Go back to _**repository**_ settings, tap on the **Share** button and now select **Blind**, and either copy the link, share it or generate the QR code. ",
    "faqContent75": "**Step 5:** Using the device where you want to securely store your data, import this _**repository**_ with access mode **Blind** ",
    "faqContent76": "That's it. You data is now securely stored. ",
    "faqContent77": "What this means is that in your spare device (or your friend’s spare device) you have created an exact replica of the original _**repository**_ that resides on your primary device, but nobody can access it, because it is **blind**, ie it doesn’t have either **read** or **write** access.  ",
    "faqTitle71": " Why is it called Secure Data Storage and  not simply Data Backup? ",
    "faqContent711": "Typically, if you want to back up your data, the backups would be created by some utility program, and they would be timestamped.  Thus, if you needed to, you would be able to go back to the previous backed up version. ",
    "faqContent712": "This is currently not the case with **Ouisync Blind** _**repositories**_.  If your **Blind** _**repository**_ is online at the same time as your original _**repositories**_, it will receive any updates that you make to your data.

    "faqContent713": "Currently, **Ouisync app** doesn’t create timestamped backups that contain previous versions of data, so you cannot go back to the version of _**repository**_ you had two weeks ago.  ",

That means that your **Blind** _**repository**_ will automatically receive all updates from your primary _**repository**_. However, if you delete any files in your primary _**repository**_, then that deletion will be propagated too, and you won't be able to retrieve those files. **Ouisync** is currently primarily a synchronization tool and not a secure backup tool.
