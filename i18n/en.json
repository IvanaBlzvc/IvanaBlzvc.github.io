    "faqTitle2b": "What happens to the contents when I delete a repository?", 
    "faqContent2b1": "When you delete a _**repository**_ on your device, this deletion is not propagated to your peer’s devices – they will still have all their _**repositories**_. ",
    "faqContent2b2": "If you delete a _**repository**_ that you have **not shared** with any other device or peer, then your Ouisync data is deleted. ",

    "faqContent3a1": "You can add **local password** to a _**respository**_ at the time of creation or import by selecting the **Use local password** option. ",

    "faqContent4a1": "Yes. On Android devices that have **Biometric protection** set up, you can use it to secure your _**Ouisync repositories**_ and to enter _**repository**_ **Security screen**. ",
    "faqContent4a2": "You can activate the **biometrics protection** at the time of creating or importing a _**repository**_.  You can also do it later on by going to the **Security screen** and activating the **Secure using biometrics** option. ",

    "faqTitle6": "What does it mean to 'import' a repository?",
    "faqContent60": "To import a _**repository**_ means that you want to recreate on your device a _**repository**_ that a peer has [shared](#sharing) with you. ",
    "faqContent61": "You start with the **+** button and then select **Import**:",
    "faqContent62": "Tapping on the **Import repository** button will bring you to this screen:",

    "faqContent66": "The imported _**repository**_ will appear on your screen and after a short while all its content will be imported into your device.  In other words, the Ouisync _**repositories**_ on your devices will sync their data with the _**Ouisync repositories**_ on your peer’s device.  This will happen automatically, without the need for your to perform any further action. ",
   
    "faqTitle6a": "How can I know when the syncing of my repositories is completed?", 
    "faqContent66a": "During the syncing, you will see these symbols next to the repository name.", 
    "faqContent67": " Once the **syncing** is complete, you will see the **green check** icon next to the _**repository name**_. This means that you now have on your device the exact copy of the _**repository**_ that your peer has shared with you.  ",
     
    "faqTitle7": "What are Blind repositories? ",
    "faqContent70": "When sharing a repository, you can decide to share it with **Blind** permission.", 
    "faqContent71": "This means that it can be imported into another device, but it cannot be read or edited or viewed on that device - it is **blind** on that device.  Its purpose is simply to securley store data on a device.", 
    "faqContent72": "Note: if your **blind** repository is online at the same time as your other repositories, it will sync with your original repository.",
    "faqContent73": "Your **Blind** _**repository**_ will receive any updates that you make to your data.  If you rename, move or delete files in your original _**repository**_, they are going to be automatically renamed, moved or deleted in your **Blind** _**repository**_ as well. ", 

    "faqTitle71": " Why is it called Secure Data Storage and  not simply Data Backup? ",
    "faqContent711": "Typically, if you want to back up your data, the backups would be created by some utility program, and they would be timestamped.  Thus, if you needed to, you would be able to go back to the previous backed up version. ",
    "faqContent712": "This is currently not the case with **Ouisync Blind** _**repositories**_.  ",
    "faqContent713": "Currently, **Ouisync app** doesn’t create timestamped backups that contain previous versions of data, so you cannot go back to the version of _**repository**_ you had two weeks ago.  ",

That means that your **Blind** _**repository**_ will automatically receive all updates from your primary _**repository**_. However, if you delete any files in your primary _**repository**_, then that deletion will be propagated too, and you won't be able to retrieve those files. **Ouisync** is currently primarily a synchronization tool and not a secure backup tool.
