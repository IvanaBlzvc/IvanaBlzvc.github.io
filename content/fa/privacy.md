## 3. Privacy Notice

This section is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the
collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use
our Service. 3.1 Data Collection The OuiSync team values user privacy and thus
does not collect any user information. The Ouisync app is designed to be able to
provide file sharing services without a user ID, name, nickname, user account or
any other form of user data. We don't know who uses our app and with whom they
sync or share their data.

### 3.2 Data Sharing
Ouisync (and eQualit.ie) does not share any data with any third parties.

### 3.3 Security Practices
Data that the user uploads into the Ouisync repositories is end-to-end encrypted
in transit as well as at rest. This includes metadata such as file names, sizes,
folder structure etc. Within Ouisync, data is readable only by the person who
uploaded the data and those persons with whom they shared their repositories.

You can learn more about the encryption techniques used in our documentation.

The Ouisync app stores users' data on an 'Always-On Peer', which is a server
located in Canada. All data is stored as encrypted chunks and is not readable by
the server or its operators. The purpose of this server is simply to bridge the
gaps between peers who are not online at the same time. All data is periodically
purged from this server - its purpose is not to provide permanent data storage
but simply facilitation of data syncing by peers.

If you have a reason to believe that your personal data has been illegaly
obtained and shared by other Ouisync users, please contact us at the address
below.

### 3.4 Deletion of your data from our Always-On-Peer server
The simplest way to delete your data is by deleting files or repositories from
your own device. Any file deletion will be propagated to all your peers - ie, if
you have Write access to a repository, you can delete any files within it and
the same files will be deleted from your peers' repositories as well as from our
Always-On-Peer. If you need to delete only the repositories from our
Always-On-Peer (but still keep them in your own repository on your own device),
please contact us at the address below.

***Note:** The Ouisync team cannot delete individual files from repositories, as
it is not possible to identify them because they are encrypted. We are able to
delete whole repositories if you send us the link to the repository that needs
to be deleted.*

### 3.5 Log Data
The OuiSync app creates logfiles on users' devices. Their purpose is only to log
device's activity to facilitate the debugging process in case the user
experiences difficulties in connecting with their peers or otherwise in using
the Ouisync app. The logfile remains on a user's device unless the user decides
to send it to us for support purposes.

If the user does decide to contact us, the personally indetifiable data we may
collect is:
* Email address - if the user decided to contact us by email;
* Information the user may provide by email, through help tickets, or through
  our website, and associated metadata - for the purposes of providing technical
  support;
* User’s IP address - for the purposes of providing technical support.

None of this data is shared with any third parties.

### 3.6 Cookies
The Ouisync app does not use cookies.

### 3.7 Links to Other Sites
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party
link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not
operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the
content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### 3.8 Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
We encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable
information through the Application and/or Services. We encourage parents and
legal guardians to monitor their childrens' Internet usage and to help enforce
this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally
identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their
permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally
identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, please
contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the
processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some
countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

### 3.9 Changes to these Terms
We may update our Terms from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this
page periodically for any changes.

This policy is effective as of 2022-03-09.
