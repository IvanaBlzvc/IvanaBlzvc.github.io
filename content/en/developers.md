# Ouisync developer information

Ouisync, apart from being an awesome file syncing app, is also a library which can be used by other
developers to implement p2p file syncing for their apps. It provides advanced peer-to-peer
connection management (including peer discovery and
[NAT traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal)) and efficient data syncing between
multiple peers. It employs state-of-the-art cryptography to protect your data both in transit and
at rest.

The library is open source and available under the
[MPL v2 license](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/). It's written in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and has bindings to [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and
[Dart](https://dart.dev/) / [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) with other languages possibly added in
the future.
