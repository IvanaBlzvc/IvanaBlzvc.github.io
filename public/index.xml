      <description>Frequently Asked Questions Getting Started   What is a repository?  A repository is simply a place where you can store and share your files and folders securely, using Ouisync. You can think of it as a root folder, or even a safe, that will contain other folders and files that you want to share with your peers.
   Where can I see my repositories?  When you open the Ouisync app, after the onboarding screens you will see the main screen listing all the repositories you have created.</description>
