      <description>Ouisync’s unique approach to guarantee encrypted file sharing Encryption in a distributed file sharing system Ouisync offers users a secure way to share and synchronize data across devices. Due to the distributed (peer-to-peer) nature of Ouisync, where concurrent changes to files and directories are possible, the directory structure of Ouisync is quite elaborate. Whenever two or more users modify a file in a directory concurrently, Ouisync’s architecture guarantees that no information is lost.</description>

      <description>Frequently Asked Questions Getting Started   What is a repository?  A repository is simply a place where you can store and share your files and folders securely, using Ouisync. You can think of it as a root folder, or even a safe, that will contain other folders and files that you want to share with your peers.
   Where can I see my repositories  When you open the Ouisync app, after the onboarding screens you will see the main screen listing all the repositories you have created.</description>
